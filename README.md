# eisenhowerToDo

Introducing a productivity website designed to optimize your task management using the Eisenhower Matrix. This platform categorizes your to-do tasks into four distinct types:

1. Important and Urgent
2. Important and Not Urgent
3. Not Important and Urgent
4. Not Important and Not Urgent

Key Features:

- **Nested Subtasks**: Each task can contain an individual list of subtasks, which can also have their own subtasks, allowing for infinite depth.
- **CRUD Operations**: Easily create, read, update, and delete tasks and subtasks.
- **Drag-and-Drop Functionality**: Reorder tasks within a list by dragging and dropping them. You can also move tasks between different quadrants of the matrix.

This comprehensive task management tool helps you prioritize and organize your tasks more effectively, enhancing your productivity.
